<p>Ambitious  GEO (Genetic Expression Omnibus) data-mining studies can be too tedious and labor intensive to perform efficiently over many datasets because each
set of thousands must be manually downloaded, cleaned, filtered, and reviewed in many bioinformatic laboratories. Further, this preliminary data curating work may be needlessly duplicated during future studies or by colleagues.</p>

<p>To mitigate this problem, MINE automates the most tedious aspects of GEO studies: to fetch, format, clean, filter, document, display, save, and share genetic datasets.</p>

<p>MINE was developed by Andrew Yates working under Professors Kun Huang and Raghu Machiraju at the Ohio State University.</p>
